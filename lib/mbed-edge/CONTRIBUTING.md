# Contributions and pull requests

Contributions to this project are accepted under the same license as this
software.

Submit only contributions where you have authored all the code.

When working with a contribution, feel free to raise an issue in Github.
This enables everyone to see if you are working with similar matter. It also
encourages people to discuss on the issues.

## Working with an enhancement

The preferred way to submit contributions is through a fork and pull requests.

* Fork the Edge repository.
* Clone it to your local development environment.
* Create a branch for the work.
* Create logical units of commits. Squash the commits to logical pieces if
  needed.
* Implement only one task per branch. If you need to work on some other
  enhancement, do it on another branch to keep concerns separate.
* Document the changes.
* Test your changes. Include tests if possible.
* Rebase your branch to the Edge repository head. Avoid merge commits.

## Submitting the enhancement

When you have completed your work and the branch in the forked repository is
ready to be submitted, verify the following requirements for your pull request:

* Make sure that all of the commits contain a `Signed-off-by` line. Use your
  real name and email address. The `Author` and `Signed-off-by` lines must
  match. If any other person contributes to the commit, they must also add
  their own `Signed-off-by` line.
* Submit your pull request to the Edge repository. The changes are reviewed and
  any comments may cause rework to the pull request.
* When the changes are approved, they will be integrated to the Edge repository.
